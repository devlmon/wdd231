        <section class="intro-section">
            <h2>Why Games Are Amazing</h2>
            <p>Games are so much more than entertainment. They are worlds of endless possibility, spaces where we can
                challenge ourselves, express creativity, and connect with others. Whether you're exploring vast
                landscapes, building something from nothing, or embarking on epic adventures with friends, games have
                the power to transform how we see ourselves and what we're capable of.</p>
            <p>Here are two games that have personally meant the most to me—games that have taught me, inspired me, and
                shown me that I'm capable of far more than I ever thought possible.</p>

                    <h3>Terraria</h3>
                    <p>Terraria is more than just a 2D sandbox—it's a journey of self-discovery. When you start with
                        nothing but a pickaxe, facing the unknown depths below, there's a feeling of vulnerability. But
                        as you gather resources, build structures, and grow stronger, something shifts. Every boss
                        defeated, every new biome explored, every challenge overcome becomes proof that you are capable.
                        Terraria teaches patience, strategy, and resilience. It whispers, "You can do this," and
                        suddenly, you believe it.</p>

                    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                    <p>Minecraft is a canvas of infinite freedom and endless adventure with friends. Build together,
                        explore biomes, create worlds, and share your imagination with people you care about. The beauty
                        of Minecraft lies not in having a single goal, but in choosing your own path—whether that's
                        building a grand castle, discovering a hidden village, or simply enjoying peaceful moments
                        crafting and mining alongside friends. It's a place where friendship grows through shared
                        creativity and collaborative adventures.</p>
